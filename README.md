SETUP YOUR DEV ENVIRONMENT
==========================

This is a setup repository to guide you threw the process of setting up **Ansible** and **Vagrant** with **New Relic** for a **node.js** based web application. It will also showcase you how to provision your **Vagrant Boxes** with **Ansible** and on top of it in OS, even on **Windows** where Ansible is not supported directly.

Another big deal it covers is **automated setup of New Relic via Ansible for machine OS monitoring**.

If anyone have any queries than feel free to raise it.
